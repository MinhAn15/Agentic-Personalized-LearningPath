# Quantum Physics: Wave-Particle Duality

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of Wave-Particle Duality
- Explain the Double-Slit Experiment
- Define the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

## 1. Introduction
Classical physics treats particles and waves as distinct entities. Quantum mechanics reveals that matter and light exhibit properties of both.

## 2. The Double-Slit Experiment
When light shines through two slits, it creates an interference pattern (wave behavior), even if photons are sent one at a time. However, if observed, they behave like particles.

## 3. Key Principles
- **Superposition**: A system exists in all possible states until measured.
- **Entanglement**: Particles can be correlated instantly across distances.

## Summary
Matter behaves as both a wave and a particle depending on observation.
