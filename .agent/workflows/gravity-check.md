description: Execute the GRAVITY Check - Strategic Alignment & Governance Review
---

# Gravity Check Protocol

This workflow executes the **Antigravity Cognitive Framework** to ensure all outputs are strategically aligned, governed, and architecturally sound.

## 1. Context & Mode Detection

**Objective**: Analyze the user request to determine the correct valid operational mode.

*   **Analyze Input**: What is the core request? (Code, Research, Plan?)
*   **Select Mode**:
    *   **MODE A (Architecture & Engineering)**: Implementation, Refactoring, System Design.
    *   **MODE B (Academic & Research)**: Thesis writing, Literature Review, Journal Submission.
    *   **MODE C (Strategic Review)**: Consulting, Roadmap, Governance.

## 2. The GRAVITY Check (5-Step Analysis)

Perform this mental check (and rigorously document it if complex):

1.  **Strategic Alignment**:
    *   *Question*: How does this serve the Master's Thesis or Business Goal?
    *   *Check*: Is it irrelevant fluff? If so, discard or refine.
2.  **Governance & Risk**:
    *   *Question*: Compliance (GDPR/AI Ethics)? Security risks?
    *   *Check*: Are we exposing sensitive data? Are we hallucinating facts?
3.  **Architecture (Functional Decomposition)**:
    *   *Question*: Where does this fit in the system (Agents 1-6)?
    *   *Check*: Adhere to `backend/core` and `models/` standards.
4.  **Execution**:
    *   *Action*: Define the Implementation Roadmap, Code changes, or Writing structure.
5.  **Evaluation**:
    *   *Metrics*: How do we measure success? (e.g., Impact Factor, Latency < 200ms, Accuracy > 90%).

## 3. Mode-Specific Execution Rules

### IF MODE A: Architecture & Engineering
*   **Focus**: Scalability, Maintainability, Technical Debt.
*   **Output Structure**:
    1.  **Architecture Diagram/Desc**: High-level view.
    2.  **Implementation**: precise code / pcode.
    3.  **Technical Debt & Risk Assessment**: Explicitly state trade-offs.
*   **Terminology**: Use MIS/Tech terms (ACID, Microservices, RBAC).

### IF MODE B: Academic & Research
*   **Structure**: Strictly **IMRAD** (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion).
*   **Publication Metrics**: Evaluate against Target Journal (Impact Factor, Q1/Q2).
*   **Tone**: Neutral, Rigorous, Citation-heavy.

### IF MODE C: Strategic Review
*   **Framework**: **8-Step MIS Strategic Review**.
*   **Tools**: SWOT, PESTLE, Risk Matrix.
*   **Output**: Matrices and Tables preferred.

## 4. Output Generation Guidelines

*   **Format First**: Use Tables, Matrices, Mermaid Diagrams.
*   **Conciseness**: Bullet points. No "I hope this helps".
*   **Language**: Professional (English/Vietnamese as requested).
*   **Raw Data Handling**: AUTOMATICALLY structure raw ideas into tables.

## 5. Completion Verification

*   [ ] Did I address the Governance implications?
*   [ ] Is the Technical Debt clearly stated?
*   [ ] Is the structure aligned with the Mode (IMRAD vs 8-Step)?
